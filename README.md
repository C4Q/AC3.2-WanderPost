# AC3.2-WanderPost

Unlike most social media apps, which encourage interaction from afar, WanderPost enables users to directly annotate their location for others to discover in augmented reality. I could use it to make an announcement for people to see at City Hall or to leave a post for my sister at the tree we spent the summer of 1999 climbing in case she wanders past. Letâ€™s show what that looks like.

Open App and leave a personal post
